A simple webapp to calculate your disappointment in hours and minutes using NodeJS and Steam Web API

To start using it: 
1. download the repo
2. copy server/config.example.js to server/config.js and fill it out with the correct info
3. run the server: `node server/server.js`

This project was made for me to learn about handling and making APIs using NodeJS. All pictures used here are royalty-free images from Pixabay.
